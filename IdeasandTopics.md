# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?
###### I care about economics, physics, astronomy, medicine, intelligence, and anything that can help advance society from a scientific perspective.
###### **Topic 1** Economics, specifically, prediciting trends in the stock market with the use of HFT data and DP data.
What do you know about?
###### **Topic 2** Physics and understanding the Universe.  Specifically trying to understand the data behind string theory. 
###### I know a lot about math, physics, astronomy, economiccs, and logic. I am able to comfortably write on these topics.  
###### **Topic 1** I know a lot about this topic because I was a trader for 14 years. 
###### **Topic 2** I have been studying physics as an amatuer, and I really enjoy learning about string theory and other concepts in theoretical physics
What decisions do you face?
###### Every one of these topics has a plethora of open ended questions, unsolved, but solvable, problems, and potentially keys to unlock new ideas.
###### **Topic 1**I faced many decisions when it came to trading, when, how, where, and what to buy/sell, etc.  The key is understanding the black box HFT trading systems.
###### they are what move the markets now.  Not the hedgers, but the pure speculators. 
###### **Topic 2** Understanding the Data and proof behind string theory. 
## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation


2. Trend related to the news
###### **Topic 1**
###### **Topic 2**
3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about
###### **Topic 2**

5. Valuable to businesses
###### **Topic 1**

6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
###### **Topic 1** I think that most people, especially the 99% of investors out there dont understand the impact that HFT and DP have on the stock markets.
###### They dont understand the depth and breadth of the volume and they are one key stroke mistake away from a massive loss. 
###### **Topic 2** I dont think most people understand the concepts or ideas behind theoretical physics, in one sense, I have a hard time too.  I like the challenge. 
## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
###### **Topic 1** Economics and Financial Markets, Money and Banking, HFT/DP
###### **Topic 2** Physics, String Theory, Understanding our unniverse as it relates to a potential multiverse

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
###### **Topic 1**
###### **Topic 2**
Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
###### **Topic 1** Yes I could do new question. How does HFT/DP trading affect markets in the aggregate.  Then, how do they affect the markets as individual trading pipelines. 
###### **Topic 2** Can data prove that that string theory exists.  There are a lot of mathematical and organic representations. Is there a pattern in the data.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
###### **Topic 1** FINCEN, FINRA, NASDAQ, NYSE, CBOT, CBOE
###### **Topic 2** MIT, String Theory Site, CERN
# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.
