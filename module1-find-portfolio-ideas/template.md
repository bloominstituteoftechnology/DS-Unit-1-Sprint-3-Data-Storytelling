## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
  - Traditional remittances solutions (Wetern Union) vs. Crypto remitances 


2. Trend related to the news


3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about
  - Investment in Gold vs inflation rates
  - Investment in Gold vs investment in the stock market during recession 
  - Investment in Gold vs investment in Bitcoin in the last 5 years 
 


5. Valuable to businesses
  - Sales of XYZ using crypto vs credit/debit cards 


6. What's the most popular?
  - Which Blockchain is the least centralized? 
  - Which Blockchain has the highest usage of Dapps?


7. Cost/Money rankings


## Misconceptions (in quotations marks)

  - "Bitcoin is only used by criminals": Crypto is a new industry with many charlatans and it's difficult to filter out bad actors 
  - "Bitcoin is hacked once again": There are massive amounts of misinformation in the industry, dissuading new entrants
  - "Fiat currency is still backed by gold": More misinformation 



## Examples (see above)
