# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?


What do you know about?


What decisions do you face?


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation


2. Trend related to the news


3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about


5. Valuable to businesses


6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

Brainstorming Ideas:
I heard Andrew Yang (2020 presidential candidate) mention as a hypothesis for why Trump got elected was that many areas in key swing states that were hit hardest by job loss due to automation voted in favor of Trump. I think it would be interesting to dive into that and see if there is data to verify that idea.

As a big fan of sports, especially the NFL, one topic in recent news was the retirement of New England Patriot Rob Gronkowski- There is general consensus that he is one of the best TEs of all time and a virtual lock for the Hall Of Fame. I got to thinking it would be cool if there was a model/algorithm for computing a players HOF score or percentage likelihood that they will make it in the hall of fame, based on their career stats. For players early in their career, projecting future production/stats would be a neat feature to play around with and see what is needed for a high percentage chance of making it in.

Another sports related idea I would like to dive into someday, as a big fan of fantasy football, is a way to quantify/predict how various injuries will impact on-field production. Factors to include in the model include the specific injury/category, a grade/rank for severity of the injury, length of time since the injury occurred, practice status, any injury setbacks (and related length of time since), etc.. Unfortunately, after a preliminary search, Im not sure this data is publicly avail in a nice tidy dataset, and the logistics of me going back a few seasons and creating the csv for each and every fantasy relevant NFL player and cataloguing their injuries, practice statuses, etc by hand into csv files might be more time consuming than I am willing to commit to at this point.

I had yet another NFL data idea involving the effects of weather. I was able to find a website that has weather data for every outdoor NFL game going back to 1937. However, it does not appear to be available in csv type format and would require scraping. I may be up for the challenge tho- def would be interesting to see/quantify how varying changes in temperature, precipitation, and wind have on scoring, yardage, turnovers, etc.
