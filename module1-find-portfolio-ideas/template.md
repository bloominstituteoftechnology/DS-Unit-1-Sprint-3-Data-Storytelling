# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

- Technology and how it can be leveraged to improve the lives and jobs available

- I have a pretty substantial background in business theory, particularly strategy development.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics?

1. Geographic Variation

-

2. Trend related to the news

- Amazon shopping preferences

3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about


5. Valuable to businesses

- Should we be investing more in R&D?
- Is there a lag between growth and market momentum?
- Is there any impact of earnings transcripts on share price? (e.g., sentiment, word choice, complexity)

6. What's the most popular?

-

7. Cost/Money rankings

- Something related to healthcare. Possibly looking at outcomes relative to expenses (there is narrative that we are not getting better outcomes, is that actually true??). Possibly looking at shifts in hospital revenue relative to outpatient.
- Looking at cohort based spending?

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

- The low hanging fruits of innovation have been picked. My hypothesis the low hanging fruits on some trees have been picked; but while we were picking those trees new trees have grown.
- I don't think people have fully internalized how much the urban, white-collar millenial has come to rely upon Amazon

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

I have been particularly inspired by a WSJ series on the future of technology which I felt incorporated data well.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?



## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

The SEC/Government publishes financial data for all public companies. There are potentially APIs that I could also plug into to get real-time market rates

# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.

I'm currently leaning toward the R&D topic (and possibly doing the Amazon one on the side)
