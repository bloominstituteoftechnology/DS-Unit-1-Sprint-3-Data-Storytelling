Locating a dataset that has not only complete information, but also information that will be interesting and easy to interpret for the viewers. 
## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

## Topic Consideration #1:

3. Who does that?

4. Answering a question people care about

5. Valuable to businesses

6. What's the most popular?

7. Cost/Money rankings

## With Topic #1:

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
Topic #1: A lot of people think Ufo sightings are in the desert, or small rural towns. I would like to examine the data and see if that is true. 
Topic #2: I am not sure what misconceptions people have about astronauts, I do not think people have much insight into what it takes to become a space explorer, so this is a possible solution. 

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
There was a team of Data Scientists from USC who originally explored the UFO dataset vs Natural Disasters. 

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Yes. 

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
Yes. I am investigating the geographical and time relationship to the ufo sightings. 

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Yes, with the astronaut angle. 

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
Nasa, Kaggle, data.world, google
