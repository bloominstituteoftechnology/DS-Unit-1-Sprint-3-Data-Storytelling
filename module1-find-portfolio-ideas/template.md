# Ideas for data storytelling
1. A comparison of education levels and reported happiness.

2. Alternatively, education and suicide rates.

It is simple, but mostly because I like it simple, and also I do not have any projects to showcase yet.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
The data I have access to is grouped by country.

2. Trend related to the news
Happiness, suicide, and happiness are relatively common topics on the news.

3. Who does that?
We can break down the data into country, gender, education, and other factors.

4. Answering a question people care about
Obviously people care about happiness and happiness.

5. Valuable to businesses
Not really.

6. What's the most popular?
Not exactly applicable.

7. Cost/Money rankings
Tangentially related is education and income, with higher education generally leading to higher income.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
Generally, people believe more money equals more happiness, which, as far as I know, it is a little bit more complicated than that.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
The World Happiness Report is an interesting people of data storytelling. 

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
The report seems to suggest that wealthier, more developed countries are happier, but I think if I look into the data and how exactly they got those answers we might get a different result.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
I could (and will) compare happiness and education, instead of happiness and GDP.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Potentially, although this is out of my reach, I could do a report not on happiness but on meaning and the general wellbeing of people across the world, not necessarily their "happiness".

## Data
