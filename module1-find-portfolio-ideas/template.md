## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
https://fivethirtyeight.com/ - Pretty much everything they do https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/women-in-comic-books/
https://www.vox.com/a/borders - Vox Borders, solid written articles and visuals as well as video

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Marvel/DC comics under represent race

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
What are the hidden borders of cities - are these borders consistently present in major cities
Does gender impact the type of story told - i.e. gumshoe detective(jessica jones) vs "detective" (batman)

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
FiveThirtyEight has a style in matplotlib, so graphs are easy. Writing style and formatting are also fairly straight forward.
