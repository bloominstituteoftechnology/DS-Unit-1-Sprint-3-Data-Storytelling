What decisions do you face?


## Seven templates

**Parking Enforcement in Washington DC**
**Public Transportation Ridership in DC**
**vs.**
**Housing Prices by Neighborhood**

Can you apply the templates to your topics?

1. Geographic Variation
Both are Geographically Dependent.  

2. Trend related to the news
Gentrification is a hot topic in the news, especially in ctities like NY, SF, and DC.

3. Who does that?
DC Government has a ton of datasets on all of these topics.

4. Answering a question people care about
Transportation (cars vs public) is a huge topic in cities. Gentrification is as well. The cross section of these two topics is a big draw

5. Valuable to businesses
Availability of Transportation incredibly important to businesses.

6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings
Money is involved in both.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
- Parking views tend to be nuanced. Overall the misconception with parking enforcement is that it is highly efficient. I have found that it follows certain anecdotal trends.

- Public Transportation vs. Gentrification. Does the WMATA keep up with the different trends in ridership demand. For example, the newest development in the city (DC Wharf) is a multibillion dollar, multi-use development that drives a lot of traffic to the area. Has WMATA modified routes or schedules to account for a previously underutilized part of the city getting enormous gains in traffic.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
http://lmart999.github.io/2015/02/28/gis/

Lance has a great bit of storytelling on crime and drug usage in SF by neighborhood.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Lance concentrated on the decline of Crack in the drug landscape of SF. It's tough to create a new hypothesis, since he didn't create a drive towards any specific thoughts outside of observation.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

I could look into how petty crime correlated with areas of certain drugs. Tie that into housing prices as well, given they tend to indicate levels of wealth and status in cities.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Absolutely. I want to focus on Urban Observation tying in Gentrification that is visualization focused.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
DC government has tons of data published on these topics. Similarly, WMATA has tons a data published *on top of* a high level of developer support.

# Assignment!
