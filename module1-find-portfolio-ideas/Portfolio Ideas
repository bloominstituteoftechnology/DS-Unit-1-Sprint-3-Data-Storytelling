What do you care about?
I am interested in doing anything that can help people out, if thats figuring out ways to minimalize
carbon dioxide and waste to help prevent global warming. Or help people in need, who might not have access to food and water. 
Also I find it very fascinating discovering things and learning new things no ones done before, to advance ourselves for 
the future!
