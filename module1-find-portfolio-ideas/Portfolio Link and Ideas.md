What do you care about?

I'm interested in using data science and data-driven methods to promote social welfare and reduce poverty.

What do you know about?

I'm somewhat familiar with the effective altruism community, and I spend a fair amount of time trying to allocate my time in the most efficient way relative to the amount of lives I can save.

What decisions do you face?

As suggested by the previous answer, the most important decision I have to deal with--perhaps the most important decison any of us can deal with--is how to spend my time in a way that prioritizes the things I value.

**Using Data Science to Do Good: Lives You Can Save**

Geographic Variation
-Using data science to work on problems that are personally important to you

Trend related to the news
-Poverty is a moral blight
-There is no shortage of social problems to be addressed

Who does that?
-What kinds of opportunities are available for people who spend some of their time working on philanthropic projects?

Answering a question people care about
-How can we as first-worlders discharge our social responsibility?

Valuable to businesses
-Philanthropy is good for public image

Cost/Money rankings
-What are the most effective ways to use our particular talents to save lives?

Misconceptions
What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
-The idea (perhaps particularly pernicious for those of us that are quantitatively oriented) that any impact we as individuals have is but a "drop in the bucket." This collective hallucination prevents enormous numbers of lives from being saved by way of complacent fatalism. Saving a few lives is immeasurably better than saving none.

Examples
What data storytelling example inspires you?

The entire catalog of past competitions at DrivenData.org is pretty exciting to behold and gives me a lot of hope for our ability to impact the world in a positive way.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

To state things explicitly:

Question: What good can we do?

Hypothesis: Leverage our particular skillsets as data scientists to give back/pay forward the gifts we've been given as citizens of the first world.

Alternative hypothesis: Contribute to effective charities.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

I could probably write about effecive altruism and the need for philanthropic giving for days.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

One of the beautiful things about giving is that it is a guilt-free, side-effect-free anti-depressant that enriches one's life in a profound way. There is no end to the stones that could be overturned in the effort for making people's lives better.

Data
Where could you search for data about your topic?

I've already contacted the DrivenData administration, but I think I'll need to search somewhat more broadly and creatively for information and ways of quantitatively describing the impact of these kinds of altruistically motivated competitions.


**Social Capital and Achievement**

Idea: I read a statistic that something like 90% of the variation in income is attributable to variations in social capital: the ambient network of relationships that allow society to function. While the exact number may be an exaggeration, this has profound implications for our responsibility to others in less fortunate situations. I would like to investigate this further and see if I can make more precise statements about the relationship between pre-existing social networks and economic and other forms of achievement.


Geographic Variation
-I could investigate the differing impacts of social environment based on different regions, climates, governmental systems, etc.
-I could also compare which kinds of places have which kinds of social environments (in other words, the reverse of the previous assessment)

Trend related to the news
-Income inequality is an incredibly important social force in determining the political environment

Who does that?
-How are social networks developed, how can we influence them and what is our responsibility when we take advantage of the resources they provide?


Valuable to businesses
-Because social capital affects the amount of money available for spending, the private sector as a whole has a vested interest in improving the situations of people in many different kinds of situations, and people in the worst situations imaginable are unable to interact with, benefit from, and ultimately contribute to the global economy. In a cynical way (this warrants some rephrasing, but I think it's relevant and important), leaving such a substantial proportion of the global population out represents a huge opportunity cost for the global economy, obviously in addition to the enormous human costs of poverty.

Misconceptions
What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
-There's a general sense that we create most of the value for the income we pull in, ignoring for example the effect of having a robust public infrastructure system (such that it is), free public education, and public health initiatives that have "gotten into the water supply," as the saying goes. Without these public goods, much of the value created would be left as potential value, not actualized.

Examples
What data storytelling example inspires you?
I refer again to the EA movement, particularly Peter Singer's book "The Life You Can Save" (from which I got the statistic I mentioned earlier). I think it's incredibly important to try to use data to influence people in a way that makes them change how they think about altruism, philanthropy, and helping people very different from them.

Data
Where could you search for data about your topic?

I have found a few datasets already at this link: https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/instructors/icsc/datasets.jsp
I plan to expand and try to find more data on this topic in the coming days and weeks.

For now I plan to work on the social capital question because I think it will be easier to find robust, descriptive data about the problem, and because it seems more straightforward to come up with clear, demonstrative hypotheses about the effects of social capital on personal achievement. I do plan, however, to at least participate in a few DrivenData competitions and blog about my experiences, even if it doesn't culminate in a full-fledged project for Lambda School.
